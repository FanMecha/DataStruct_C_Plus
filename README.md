# 🚀 LeetCode Practice & Data Structures in C++

Welcome to my personal journey of improving C++ programming skills through solving LeetCode problems and learning core data structures and algorithms.

This repository serves as a learning log, coding playground, and a collection of well-documented solutions — all implemented in modern C++.

## 📌 Goals

- Strengthen fundamental knowledge in data structures and algorithms
- Improve problem-solving and coding efficiency in C++
- Build a consistent study and coding habit

---

## ✍️ Study Plan

I'm following a learn-by-doing approach:

1. Study one data structure or algorithm topic each week  
2. Solve 3–5 related LeetCode problems  
3. Summarize key takeaways and patterns in notes  
4. Review and refactor solutions regularly
